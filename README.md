# Hero Section Code Challenge

This project is a pixel-perfect implementation of the Feeble Hero Section based on the provided Figma design.

The goal of the assignment was to accurately translate the design into code while preserving layout precision, animations, interactions, and responsiveness.

## Tech Stack

- React – Component-based UI development
- Vite – Fast development server and build tooling
- Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling for precise spacing and layout
- Ant Design – UI components and typography consistency
- Framer Motion – Animations and interactive transitions

## Assumptions & Implementation Notes

- Font sizes and spacing were matched visually using Figma inspection tools
- Minor sub-pixel differences may exist due to browser rendering differences
- Ant Design components were customized where necessary to match the design
- Animations were implemented to prioritize smoothness and realism over excessive motion
- The cloud and birds were removed on the mobile version of the site
